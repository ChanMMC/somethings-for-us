    When we see others do journalling you might want to try one day right?But as you know it need many stuffs especially stickers so we just stare them creating a nice pretty journal😞<br>

!!BUT IN HERE YOU MAY DO JOURNALLING WITH MANY STICKERS!!<br>
And mark your day with an emoji given by them.<br>
You can also crete your own emoji yayyy<br>
Sorry if my "about app" need more informations cause their "about app" is writen in chinese,so..😶<br></dd>
