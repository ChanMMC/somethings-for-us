        <p>These tips below are the 10 tips which could be effective for your study.They are not written by me.They are from<br>
        <a href="https://www.globalcognition.org/">Global Cognition</a> website which I found out last year when I don't know anything how to study and how do i make myself want to study.<br>
    And I take time reading from that website and it helps.I developed.And luckily,I found it back so I planned to add this.There are more study tips there.And also you can practise and explore about learning science,<br>
culture and collaboration,thinking and deciding and learniing and adaptablity.</p>
<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 1: Focus on mastery</h2><br>
Learning matters.<br>

It doesn’t end with High School or College. You will be doing it for your whole life.<br>

In a quickly changing world, learning is survival. The better you get at learning new things, the more powerful you become.<br>

For each class you take, try to grasp the material as deeply as possible. Push yourself to learn new topics, even if they seem really tough at first.<br>

Aim to become a better learner than you are right now.<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 2: Find the value for you</h2><br>
It’s common to complain that we don’t learn anything useful or relevant in school. That the subject matter is just not important.<br>

Sure, it’d be nice if teachers did more to point out the applications of the topics they cover. Yet, it’s also easy to dismiss anything they do say, as not relevant to you.<br>

The best students start with the idea that there is some value, and then try to figure out what it is.<br>

You can brainstorm, or search the web for phrases like: What’s an application of X? How does X get used? Answer for yourself: How is this relevant to my life?<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 3: Take charge of your learning</h2><br>
It’s rough.

School can make you feel like you have zero control.<br>

Of course, you’ll gain more say in what you study as you advance levels. You can also start taking charge now by controlling how you learn.<br>

Use the teacher’s lesson plan and assignments as a starting point. A guide to what you need to know. Then set your own agenda to get it down.<br>

Taking control of your learning is the start to ruling your world. Own it.<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 4: Build your competence and gain confidence</h2><br>
Do you believe you can get straight A’s? Do you think you can master any subject?

Believing in your ability really helps you push in and learn something new.<br>

Your confidence may inflate easily if you often hear how smart you are. But that confidence is unstable. Easily lost.<br>

To get lasting confidence, you have to show yourself that you can.<br>

So, pick one thing. Learn it deeply. See how you do. Rinse and repeat. Over time, you’ll see that you really can learn any new thing.<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 5: Think critically about what you’re learning</h2><br>
Do you feel like you’re supposed to swallow all that your teachers tell you in one big gulp? And then regurgitate for the test?<br>

Well, you don’t have to consume your courses that way.<br>

You can approach learning like a master chef. Slice and dice the ideas. Chew them up in little bits. Taste the flavors and decide if they agree with your palette. Think of a dish that you might create.<br>

Too obscure? Oops. How about…<br>

Question the ideas. Scrutinize them. Consider other possibilities. See if you find the notions convincing. Build your own ideas off of the material presented.<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 6: Frame it your way</h2><br>
Imagine reading back over your notes. They’re a complete mess. Your chicken-scratches don’t help, sure. But there’s a bigger problem.<br>

The ideas don’t really seem to flow in a way that makes sense to you.<br>

Guess what?<br>

That’s ok. There’s not really one best way to present ideas for everyone, because our minds are all different. But, you can reorganize the ideas your way.<br>

Rearrange the ideas. Represent them in a manner that clicks for you.<br>

Pull out the major points and make an outline. Put them in a table. Draw a diagram. Create a concept map. Make them yours.<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 7: Use grades to keep on track with learning</h2><br>
There’s no denying. It feels good to get a high grade. And it’s fun to show your family and friends.<br>

Grades are also a sign of how well you are learning the material. Use them to gauge how effectively you are studying.<br>

Getting a low grade? Don’t quit. And don’t get mad at the teacher. Change how you study for your class. Look at your new scores to see how that’s working. No improvement? Never give up. Try something else. And when you do see them move up – celebrate!<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 8: Rehearse and remember</h2><br>
Imagine you got the lead in your school play. How would you get your lines down?<br>

You’d rehearse! You’d practice saying them. Several times, without looking.<br>

Treat your tests the same way. It’s a little more private (unless you have orals), but you’re still going on stage.<br>

Get the ideas clear from your notes and readings. These are your lines. Use topic headings or key words as your “stage cues.” And rehearse. No matter what format the test.<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 9: Pull your scattered ideas together</h2><br>
You took notes in class. You read the textbook. You did the homework. But the ideas are scattered about your mind like an unsolved jigsaw.<br>

It feels like you’re missing a key piece of the puzzle.<br>

Don’t worry. This is totally normal. You need to take another step in your studying, and it’s pretty simple.<br>

Compare the main ideas from the different sources. Look for the connections between the notes and the book. Ask yourself how they relate. Put the pieces together and solve the puzzle.<br>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(249, 252, 65);">Study Tips 10: Follow the clues to recover lost memories</h2><br>
You’ve studied well.<br>

You’re doing pretty well on this quiz. But you can’t remember the answer to #3. You know you knew it. It’s on the tip of your tongue, but you can’t pry it out.<br>

What do you do?<br>

Don’t cry (or pry). There’s a simple trick that can help to find that elusive memory.<br>

Think of what else you know about the topic. Or visualize yourself back in your study place. Follow these related memories as clues to track your target and flush it out.<br>
